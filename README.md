--->I'm Horse942 and am age 75.
I'm interested in Cybersecurity Risk identification and Analysis as well as Data Governance.  I'm especially concerned about RISK in regard to exfiltration of data 
via non-conventional means - through the application of physics, sound, radio waves, and other environmental variables.
An IEEE presentation several months ago by an MIT professor helped development of the idea of molecular modification to identify potential vulnerabilities, 
which I learned about a few days ago.  Those vulnerabilities / RISKS have been demonstrated in initial experiments.
I'm currently researching multiple venues in pursuit of additional insight.
